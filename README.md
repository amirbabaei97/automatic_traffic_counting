# Car Counter App

## Description
The Car Counter App is a tool designed to track and count cars in a video by defining polygons in a frame and then counting the cars that have passed through them. The application utilizes YOLO for object detection and tracking.

## Features
- Load video files and capture a frame for polygon definition.
- Draw multiple polygons by clicking on the frame.
- Track cars passing through the defined polygons using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- Save the results to a CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- PIL
- NumPy
- YOLOv5

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Select a video file to start.
3. Define polygons by clicking on the frame.
4. Press 'c' to finalize polygon definition.
5. The application will process the video and output the tracking results.

## Configuration
- Configure polygons and polygon pairs in `polygons_combinations.txt`. This file is automatically generated if you use the GUI.
- Update YOLO model path if necessary in `process_video.py`.

## Output
- The results are saved in `car_tracking_results.csv`.

## Files
- `main.py`: The main application file for the GUI.
- `process_video.py`: Contains the logic for video processing and car tracking.
